I am an Assistant Professor at [Ponce Health Sciences University](https://www.psm.edu/) in Puerto Rico. I teach courses about research methods and psychological and cognitive assessment in the School of Behavioral and Brain Sciences.

I am a researcher at the [Cognition, Health, and Technology Laboratory (CLTLab](https://cognition-learning-tech-lab.github.io/); co-led by Dr. Mario E. Bermonti-PÃ©rez). Our research endeavors focus on leveraging technology to comprehend neuropsychological functioning in both healthy individuals and those grappling with mental and physical health challenges. My primary areas of research revolve around cognition and psychological functioning in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression, as well as gastrointestinal disorders, particularly Celiac Disease. I am affiliated with esteemed organizations such as the Psychological Association of Puerto Rico, the Inter-American Psychological Society, the International Society for the Study of Celiac Disease, and the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science, among others.
